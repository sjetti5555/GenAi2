 to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 27
Natural language processing (NLP) : this domain deals with bridging the gap of
communication between the computer and human languages. It is basically the inter-
action between computer and human in a smart way. Google translator and spell checkare some of the examples under NLP domain.
2 Subsets of Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial intelligence has emerged as a boon for the society for the furtherance of
advanced techniques to deal with the real-life problems. The major two subsets of
AI are Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). ML is considered as thesubset of AI and DL is considered as the subset of ML. The pictorial representation
of the relationship between AI, ML, and DL is shown in Fig. 2.
2.1 Machine Learning
As humans can think, improve by self-improvement cycle, and learn from the past
experiences, AI machines can also learn from the past experiences with the help of
the concept known as Machine Learning (ML). The machine learning deals with the
development of algorithms that enables the computer to learn from its data and pastexperiences on their own [ 4]. In this method, the machine analyzes the available data
set which is also known as training data and with the help of the algorithms predict thepossible output over the given input. More the data (information) is provided, moreperfect is the performance or prediction. In other words, the relationship between
the data and efﬁciency is that the machine can improve its efﬁciency by gaining
