28 M. Ghosh and A. Thirugnanam more and more data. It can learn from the data and improve automatically. This is very much helpful for dealing with huge data of complex problems, which are difﬁcult for humans to deal with and they also consume more time in solving. In thisprocess of computing the machine receives data as input and provides result using an appropriate algorithm. Classiﬁcation of Machine Learning Based on the nature of the learning signal or response that the machine gets; machine learning can be classiﬁed into following categories: (i) Supervised learning (ii) Unsupervised learning (iii) Reinforcement learning.
