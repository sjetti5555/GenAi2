undergoing such learning methods. As the number of layers increases, it is called as deep learning or Deep Neural Network (DNN) [ 8]. The initial layer is denoted as the input layer, the last layer is called the output layer and the intermediate layers are termed as the hidden layer, where all the layers are interconnected [ 9]. The amount of the depth of the network in terms of layers decides how efﬁcient thealgorithm can do the dense representation of any data (for example, in an image, theedge, boundaries, etc., are the required data needed for representation). This method has
