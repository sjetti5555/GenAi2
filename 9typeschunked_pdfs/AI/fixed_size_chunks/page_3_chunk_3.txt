assistants are considered for humans, manual(in the form of robots), and digital (Chatbots) which can perform risky, repetitive, and troublesome tasks. The task of developing such machines is accomplished by minutely studying the human behavior and implementing the logic in the form of algorithms resulting in inventions of software, devices, robots, etc., making human race smarter. There are many areas which contribute to artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence which includes mathematics (used for developing algorithms), biology, philosophy, psychology,neuroscience (for studying human mind and its behavior), statistics (for handlinghuge data), and last but not the least, computer science (to run the algorithm for implementing
