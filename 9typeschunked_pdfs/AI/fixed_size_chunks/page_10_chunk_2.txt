has helped in medical image analysis. Deep CNN has its great usage in radiologyand pathology as well. For instance, it can help in esophageal endoscopy for detecting esophageal cancer [ 12]. The schematic diagram (Fig. 4) describes how the image recognized by the network [ 13,14]. The CNN network is widely used method and algorithm in the application of deep learning and is basicallyused for image identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation. The algorithms are developed in a manner to deal with the pixel data. The basic CNN network consists oftwo parts, i.e., feature extractor and classiﬁer. The feature extractor contains the convolutional
