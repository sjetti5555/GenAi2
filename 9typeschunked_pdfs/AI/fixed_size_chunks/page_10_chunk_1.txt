Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 31 the system, learn from the data and produce results. Some of the major appli- cations of the RNN are the Chatbots, fraud detection algorithms in monetary transaction, providing caption for images, and many more [ 11]. (c) Convolutional neural networks : the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the most widely used neural networks which have multi-layered neuralnetwork. The CNN is considered to be the most efﬁcient form of neural networkwhich is basically used for feature extraction of images and pattern recognition. It has a wide range of application in the ﬁeld of medical diagnosis and
