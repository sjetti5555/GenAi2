the capability of working upon unstructured data and provides efﬁcient results. This includes intake of large amount of data known as bigdata and assures better performance with respect to the complex data [ 10]. It helps in enhanced feature extraction, pattern recognition of complex dataset and high-level data extraction. The main advantage is that it can learn without any predeﬁned data and does not require explicit programming by the programmers. The process of deep learning begins with the understanding the problem given, identifying the data, selecting theproper algorithm followed by training and testing the model. 2.3.1 Types of Neural Networks
