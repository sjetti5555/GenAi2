system and still there is more scope for research and development. Thevarious application of deep learning and machine learning has helped in better disease detection and diagnosis process. Furthermore, the use of deep learning in image anal- ysis and data extraction from medical images has helped in detecting some deadly diseases. It has also its impact in radiology and the use of robots in medical diagnosis process has its own signiﬁcance. Artiﬁcial intelligence has also spread its spectrumto advance level of medical application and many more research results are leading to a new venture of application in health sciences. It
