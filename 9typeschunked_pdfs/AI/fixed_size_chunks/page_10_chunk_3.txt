and pooling layers whose purpose is to extract the minute features from the image in terms of pixel data. The convolutional layer deals with the feature extraction of the image and preserving the relevant data about the pixels. It reveals the information like edge, boundaries of a image. The poolinglayers reduce the dimensionality of an image while retaining the important information. As CNN is a multilayer neuron network, the role classiÔ¨Åer part of the network is to classify the information obtained from convolution andpooling layers. This role is played by the fully connective layer whose motive is to connect each
