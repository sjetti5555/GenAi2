gene sequence consists of base pairs made up of (A, T, C, G); general DNA sequencing took much time but after the invent of a technology called as high throughput sequencing (HTS) which helps to perform the DNA sequencing in less than a day. The alterations done in that sequenceis termed as gene editing. Many AI platforms have been developed to enhance the HTS for a better representation of genome such as DeepV ariant. Overall, AI has efÔ¨Åciently aided the healthcare system and expected to do more in near future related to genome editing and more advancements including the genetic
