development of machine learning technology along with integrated computer visionapplications by Blue River Technologies aimed to optimize the herbicide and pest control. This technology helps to distinguish between the affected and normal parts of the plant. The “see and spray” project of Arkansas, USA, using this technology,got reduction in the required amount of expenses for weedicides per acre of land.
