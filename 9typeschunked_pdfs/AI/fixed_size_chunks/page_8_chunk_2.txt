and eventually improves by self-learning and provides output with required accuracy and efÔ¨Åciency. 2.3 Deep Learning Deep Learning (DL) is considered as the subdomain of ML and thereby the subset of AI. In ML, the system is provided with given input data sets and subjected to self-learning from the past experiences and give predictions as output. Deep learningcan be denoted as the next level of machine learning where the system is similar to human nervous system and mimic the working of the neurons. In ML the system is mostly put either in supervised or unsupervised learning method with multilayers ofalgorithms
