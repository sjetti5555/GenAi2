Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 29 2.2 Challenges and limitation of ML The basic challenge and limitation for ML are that it requires huge amount of data. Without quality data, ML algorithm cannot provide accurate results for further anal-ysis. The prediction can be considered best if the analysis is done over a large amount of data. Another point is that the data need to be heterogeneous as well. With wide range of inputs or datasets, the efﬁciency of the algorithm will be enhanced withappropriate output. It is similar to that of a new entrant in an organization making mistakes as junior
