, and DL. 4.5 Genome Editing This is totally a different aspect of AI application in which the focus is on thefeatures of genetic composition of a person. They try to get the relationship between the occurrence of the disease and the changes it made to the genes. Using the AI and ML techniques, scientists are now able to know the genomic data using gene editingand sequencing techniques. Gene editing can be described as the technique involved in DNA mutations with some alterations in the target sequence such as insertion, deletion, and substitutions [ 28]. It is known that the
