DL is considered as the subset of ML. The pictorial representation of the relationship between AI, ML, and DL is shown in Fig. 2. 2.1 Machine Learning As humans can think, improve by self-improvement cycle, and learn from the past experiences, AI machines can also learn from the past experiences with the help of the concept known as Machine Learning (ML). The machine learning deals with the development of algorithms that enables the computer to learn from its data and pastexperiences on their own [ 4]. In this method, the machine analyzes the available data set which is also known
