data provided at the input are not labeled or classiﬁed. Thealgorithm has to train itself by searching the degree of similarities among the given data and ﬁgure out the appropriate output for the given problem. The algorithm helps to reﬁne the data which can be correlated with the desired output. The algorithmsare classiﬁed into clustering and association types [ 6,7]. Reinforcement learning : this method is typically a feedback-based learning method. In this method the machine is given a reward for every right action taken by it and a penalty for any wrong action, so it is a self-learning method
