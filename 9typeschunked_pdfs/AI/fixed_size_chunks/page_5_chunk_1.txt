26 M. Ghosh and A. Thirugnanam 1.3 Domains of AI The major domains of AI (Fig. 1) are neural network, robotics, expert systems, fuzzy logic systems, natural language processing (NLP). Neural networks : these can be described as the representation of human neural system, i.e., neurons and dendrites in the form of layers and nodes representing data. It comprises algorithms that understand the relationships between the data while mimicking the human brain. These are widely used in AI in the form of machine learning and deep learning. Some of the typical examples are pattern recognition offace and image recognition in
