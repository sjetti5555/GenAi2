done by analyzing its past performances. The objective of the algorithm is to achieve maximum rewardpoints. Examples for reinforcement learning is a robotic dog learning by its own mistakes and performances, computer playing video games by their own. The machine learning algorithm is widely being used in multiple ﬁelds such as medical diagnosis, image processing, web search engines, photo tagging applica-tions, ﬁnance and marketing sector, fraud detection, weather forecasting, and many more. The main advantage is the repetitive process and self-learning methods that itapplies to ﬁnd the output.
