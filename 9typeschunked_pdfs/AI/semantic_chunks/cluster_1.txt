 However,
for researchers, it can be considered that sky is not the limit for new inventions
3 million jobs by 2020
 It is a cutting-edge technology
which has its impact in almost every ﬁeld, be it business, defense, aerospace, or health
care systems
 It has been considered as a great threat to thesociety by scientists including Stephen Hawking
 It does not have the facility of data storage for storing
the past and future data
 It completely depends on the present data

Limited memory : these are the machines which can store the past experience or
store the memory for limited period of time
, are classiﬁed under thiscategory
 Examples of fuzzylogic systems used are in consumer electronics, automobiles, comparison of data,
etc
 Google translator and spell checkare some of the examples under NLP domain
 More the data (information) is provided, moreperfect is the performance or prediction
 Thirugnanam
more and more data
 One example of this method
is spam ﬁltering [ 5,6]
 The algorithmsare classiﬁed into clustering and association types [ 6,7]
 The prediction can be considered best if the analysis is done over a large amount
of data
 Another point is that the data need to be heterogeneous as well
, are the required data needed for representation)
 This method
has the capability of working upon unstructured data and provides efﬁcient results

This includes intake of large amount of data known as bigdata and assures better
performance with respect to the complex data [ 10]

The main advantage is that it can learn without any predeﬁned data and does not
require explicit programming by the programmers
 It does not contain any recurrent movement of information

It has a wide range of application in the ﬁeld of medical diagnosis and has
helped in medical image analysis
 Deep CNN has its great usage in radiologyand pathology as well
 For instance, it can help in esophageal endoscopy for
detecting esophageal cancer [ 12]
 The schematic diagram (Fig
 4) describes
how the image recognized by the network [ 13,14]
 The algorithms are developed
in a manner to deal with the pixel data
 It reveals the information like edge, boundaries of a image
 As a result, whatever image

 With time,
it has played a signiﬁcant role in helping the human generation to become moreadvanced and equipped than ever before
 It can be mentioned that it has spread the
broad spectrum of its application from “the soil to the space”
 It has a great impact in the health sector which has helped
to bridge the gap between technology and medicine, in diagnosing the patients
 It
requires data accuracy and security and the trust of the patients on the system
 As already mentioned, the spectrum of its
application has spread from soil to space as a booming technology for the bettermentand development of human life
1 Agriculture
The agriculture is the backbone of any country and hence improving this sector with
the help of technology is essential
 Considering the world scenario, the agriculturesector shall be capable of producing almost 50% more food than being produced now
 Going with the phases of farming, AIis used in the analysis of soil and its monitoring, advancement in crop sowing phase,
 In this regard, it tells which seed should be opted for speciﬁc type of
soil
 It predicts in reducing the use of harmful chemical fertilizers used to enhance theplant growth and monitors the irrigation method thereby saving water
 According to
a study done in Alfalfa, California, the use of Geographic Information System (GIS),
in the irrigation method has helped to enhance the crop output by 35% and reductionin the amount of water used for irrigation
 Hence it helps in improving the agriculture process assuring better yield andproﬁt for the concerned farmers
 According to a study in 2016, pilot project with 175 farmers wasinitiated by ICRISA T (The International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics) with partnership of Microsoft in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, India
whose objective was to increase the level of output (about 30%) with decrease in
the investment done prior to the farming
 It was equipped with the alert messages
provided to the farmers regarding the most suitable dates for cropping, land prepara-tion, and usage of fertilizer using this app which works and gives required results by
taking the images uploaded by the farmers from the user end
 This technology helps to distinguish between the affected and normal parts
of the plant
 The “see and spray” project of Arkansas, USA, using this technology,got reduction in the required amount of expenses for weedicides per acre of land
2 Business, Banking, and Finance
This industry or sector is very important and delicate to protect the data and recordsof millions of customers
 The prime factor is the trust, data transparency, and security
of the customers
 Similarly, the business and retail market are
also getting beneﬁted by improvised methods of customer handling and providingfaster and safer services
 The world of e-commerce is highly affected by its high-level
of customer interaction

detection of real frauds
 Another study revealed that the payment fraud over anomaly
of data is nicely dealt by a client bank using the software Feedzai, using which thebank got a hike of 78% of new customers
 DataVisor software helped a bank in USA
to detect the fraud in loan and repayments and get proﬁt by 30% with a high accuracy
of 90%
 Elsevier
undergone a digital transformation from being a publisher to a tech with the help of
big data and machine learning
3 Education
This is the sector of any nation which transforms the nation after all students are thefuture of the nation
 Considering India only where it is assumed that almost more
than half of the population is of age lesser than 25, therefore, it is much more crucial
to protect the data shared by the students and provide the best form of education
 In
this pandemic year, it is not unknown how technology has equipped the education
sector to continue the process of education be it in schools, colleges, or research
Apps like Zoom, Microsoft Teams have made it possible or easy to impart knowledge
online and from distance

According to Content Technologies Inc
 It successfully
detected 19,500 students record who are more likely to dropout in Visakhapatnam
district for the year (2018–2019) so that precautionary counseling sessions could bearranged to counsel the students
 Not only the students, teachers also got beneﬁtted
from these technologies as it optimized searches in Wikipedia or e-learning courses
from various organizations
 A case study depicts the use of Pearson’s Write-To-Learn
app for the betterment of writing skills
 This app provides tips, hints, and personalized
feedbacks to improve the writing skills of the learner be it student or any teacher
 The highly efﬁ-
cient digitally strong technologies have provided awesome movies and work pieceswhich includes high power editing, imaging, and sound effects
 It has transformed the
media industry
 Starting from the camera effects to the action effects everything has
been improved
 Probably the superpowers having a huge fan following are nothingusing technology
 It has made the online game in social
media possible with multiple participants
 The main twofactors which are of major concerned are the patient’s data privacy and security
 Any
technology which is introduced mainly focus on these two factors
 This includes
development of different apps including data collection apps, digital Chatbots forconsultation on primary basis, image detection, and analysis using speciﬁc algo-
rithms
 It cannot assure to avoid death but
can assure prevention and precaution by the following ways:
(i) It has served as high-level data mining tool : with the help of AI, researchers
can get help to ﬁght the disease
 Information like the nature of the virus,
the symptoms, crucial data from other research papers, and records of pastincidents are available by data mining methodologies

(ii) As a predictor : the Corona outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China
 The fact
that it turned into a pandemic and all such related information were predicted
 It is being identiﬁed that BlueDot and Metabiota
uses AI and ML to predict the pandemic outbreak

(iv) Tracking the patients : it is the most prevalent job that is being done to keep
the record of the active, recovered, and death cases
 Microsoft developed aCorona online tracker to track the status of the virus and its possible predictions
based on the present data
 Similarly, the Indian government also developedits own website to track Corona infected persons
 The very famous Aarogya
Setu App developed by the Ministry of Telecommunication and Information
Technology, Government of India, helped to guide citizens in tracking thenearby affected patients and to take necessary preventive measures
 AI has
helped to ﬁght back the pandemic from this deadly virus
 Smart
city is a term, which has become a point of measure of urbanization of a nation
A smart city can be described as the city with technologies to make the life of
people much easier and advanced
 Similarly, smart transportation signiﬁes the way
of handling the transportation and controlling the trafﬁc and accidents which is reallya matter of concern due to large number of deaths on highways and roads [ 18]
 As
people in smart cities are more likely to use smart technologies, it is obvious thatthe data security will become a major concern
 They also
play a crucial role in crowd management and cybersecurity in smart cities
 It may be the
automated airbags or the water splashes to the alarming sounds if the driver gets tosleep while driving
 The broader applications of intelligent transportation systems
are the use of CCTV cameras installed in the highways to keep track and record
of all the activities
 Google map needs no extra explanation how it is helping intracking the one who is traveling and tracing the places one needs to travel
 It also
helps in suggesting different routes to control the congestion
 Based on a study it
was found that almost more than 500 train accidents occurred from 2012 to 2017 inIndia, out of which 53% was due to the derailment
 These technologies are being used and will be used further forthe betterment of the nation and the world
 Starting from the satellite communication
to the rovers moving around the Mars surface many activities needs to be performedby its own or without any instruction from the space station

From another study it was reported that SKICA T (Sky Image Cataloging and
Analysis Tool) performed beyond the expectations of human and was able to classifymany images having lower resolution during the span of second Palomer Sky Survey
 It has made the diagnosis process much moreeffective, efﬁcient, faster, and much more reliable
 It never aims to replace the doctors
but to help them in making their service easier
 It basically acts as an assistant to
the physician
,virtual and physical
 Virtual branch deals with clinical data management and the
physical branch mostly deals with the use of robots [ 19]
 It has many applications
such as assisting in diagnosis, in surgery, with the help of speciﬁcally designed robots
and equipment helping in guiding the patients about the particular disease
 It also
helps to aware them and restricts them from getting affected with the help of Tele-
treatment technologies
 It is also used in signal and image processing along withsome crucial predictions regarding the organs
 It has also assisted the physicians
in maintaining their daily schedule by acting as a reminder to them
 It also helps
the patients in keeping track with the doctor regarding their pre- and post-surgery

 The medical data and records maintenance, the payment facility, and
many more applications are used in the healthcare system
 Since healthcare system
is one of the most important sectors for any nation, it really needs to be improveda lot to facilitate the people and enhance quality treatment in this sector
 Based on some case studies on the
combating technologies for the most common deadly disease which is cancer a soft-
ware was introduced by the IBM, namely, Watson for oncology, including both ML
and NLP technologies, in 2016
 It helped the patients to get to know about the correct
Fig
 Another ongoing
project is the Biobank for cancer patients which helped to bridge the gap between
the imaging done by radiologists and by the machine and ﬁnd out some very minutedetails
 One more case study talks about the e-healthcare and consultation service
provided by the UK-based AI Babylon in 2018
 There are many exam-ples of medical imaging being improved by the implementation of deep learningalgorithms be it in detecting the correct disease at the right time or throughout the
diagnosis process like eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetes detection,
risk prediction and control, and also the heart disease monitoring systems [ 21,22]
 There is no limit to its application under proper implementation and
ideologies
These factors are very much important for any technology to be trusted and used by
the general public
 Another factors includes the rate of availability of the services
to the people in need at correct time which aims at the digitizing the nation totallybecause it is known that the rural areas lack the facilities and also the doctors move
to town and cities for their improvement
 So, the rural remains the same in most of
the cases, thereby the prime job is to provide the service where it is much needed
 Currently, the whole world is going digitized at a higher rate and is in the grip
of technology assisted services
 With the help of technologies, such as cloud storage
and devices based on mobile computing methods, the digital universe is existing andworking efﬁciently
 It provides lots of data to store, keep track of and retrieve at a
higher speed
 Based on a report by the International Data Corporation (IDC), the

 Thirugnanam
data size of this digitized universe will be almost 40,000 Exabytes (EB) by the end
of 2020
 Similarly, by the use of AI and relevant technologies in healthcare system, it
is generating large amounts of data in the form of EHR (Electronic Health Record),EMR (Electronic Medical Record), PHR (Personal Health Record), MPM (Medical
Practice Management software), and other digital records related to the patients and
physicians
 The biggest challenge is to manage, maintain the privacy and securitynorms of all these data
 This huge amount of data is stored in the data
warehouse and then analysis is done to produce the effective and feasible outcomes

One of the important features of the healthcare big data is that it is unstructured
and heterogeneous type which again becomes more challenging in terms of proper
management

In this scenario ML, DL, and NLP works as a boon to this sector which helps
to solve many problems related to database management
 Whether it is the dataextraction from various medical images (CT, MRI, X-ray, ECG, EMG, PET, and
EEG) or to manage the medical records; is very easy with use of advanced level
of algorithms [ 24]
 But it must accept the challenges for the proper management of
database and accomplish the task of managing the healthcare big data
 Some of the
basic challenges are data storage, accuracy, availability, data cleaning, data integrity,
data sharing, and security
 Talking about thedevices, it is only the machinery and equipment that come into our mind which mostly
includes surgical equipment, image capturing, and analyzing devices
 But to a large
extent, software is the most essential medium used in the device to analyze, inter-pret, and solve health-related problems in diagnosis and treatment of diseases
 The
classiﬁcation of medical devices is primarily based on three basic categories (Fig
 6)
and all the recent developments are classiﬁed based on these major classiﬁcations
 This app helps the
diabetic patient to monitor the sugar levels along with the proper guidance for food
habits and all the information regarding healthy eating habits
 In 2017, the Medtronic
again introduced a device asserting automatic insulin control and stabilization in thebody throughout the day
 The device named as MiniMed 670G system was launched
with the approval of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
 In 2017, computerized

 6 Image depicting three
main categories of medical
devices development
CT scans was introduced by the GE health care in collaboration with NVIDIA
 It
enhanced the medical imaging process and ensures the capture of minute details of
affected body parts which is not possible to get by physically looking at the scan
data

The invention of IoT and AI has given many devices in form of various mobile
apps to monitor the body required to maintain good health
 Patient monitoring systemis also a device or system for monitoring the patients’ detailed activity and helps tocontrol the deterioration of the body by giving feedback and suggestions
 One such
development is IntelliVue Guardian Solution, which was done by Philips Healthcares
which uses the concept of artiﬁcial intelligent and makes appropriate predictions foreffective and early managing of health status of a patient
The basic drug development process includes various steps such as the drug target
identiﬁcation and validation, new drugs design, repurposing of drugs, improvement
in research and development, asserting biomedicine conformation, and ﬁnally theclinical trials on patients [ 25]
 Thirugnanam
to be designed
 This type of job was performed by the company Tessella
 It also takes the help of computer-aided designtechniques to design the drugs for speciﬁc requirements [ 26]
 These basically make use of the natural
language processing methods and help the healthcare industry to provide digitizedservice
 They also provide consultation regarding food habits, exercise, and othertips to stay healthy
 It helps to take necessary preventive measures by the users in
order to protect themselves from getting affected with any disease and keep track of
their health
 Many services companies like Sensely, Y our
MD, Babylon HealthTap+
, Pact
 They try to get the relationship between
the occurrence of the disease and the changes it made to the genes
 Gene editing can be described as the technique involved
in DNA mutations with some alterations in the target sequence such as insertion,
deletion, and substitutions [ 28]
 It is known that the gene sequence consists of base
pairs made up of (A, T, C, G); general DNA sequencing took much time but after the
invent of a technology called as high throughput sequencing (HTS) which helps to
perform the DNA sequencing in less than a day
 The alterations done in that sequenceis termed as gene editing
 It has put its incredible and efﬁcient impacts
on almost every sector, from agriculture to education and even to the space tech-
nology
 It has greatly assisted the healthcare system for making it more efﬁcientin providing the services to the patients and being affordable and feasible for use
 It has also its impact in radiology and the use of robots in medical diagnosis
process has its own signiﬁcance
 It has greatly changed the daily
activities by digitalizing the universe and getting beneﬁts from the predictive anal-ysis
 Furthermore, the cost of
implementation and the complexity of the used algorithms if can be reduced will be
of much use in health care systems
