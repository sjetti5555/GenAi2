1 Introduction
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is a domain of computer science which deals with the
development of intelligent computer systems, which are capable to perceive, analyze,
and react accordingly to the inputs [ 1,2]
 It is well-known fact that humans are consid-
ered as the most intelligent and smart species on earth
 The features which have helped
them to bag this title include the ability to think, apply logic, do reasoning, under-
stand the complexity, and make decisions on their own

invention is the computer, which plays a signiﬁcant role in reducing the workload of
humans and solving many complex mathematical and logical problems
 So,they tried to create a “man-made homosapien” species, which can be related to the
world of computers in the form of AI (which are Artiﬁcial, i
, manmade, and Intel-
ligence, i
 If a system can have the basic skills like learning,
reasoning, self-improvement (by learning from experience), language understanding,and solving problems, then it can be assumed that there is the existence of AI
 The AI
has been used and implemented in many ﬁelds especially in technological domainand is expected to provide 2
 It can also be denoted as the method of simulation of human intelli-gence designed or programmed by humans
 With the help of AI, a well-equipped
life is generated where the automated machines work for humans, saving their time
and energy
 Basically, two types of assistants are considered for humans, manual(in the form of robots), and digital (Chatbots) which can perform risky, repetitive,
and troublesome tasks
 The task of developing such machines is accomplished by
minutely studying the human behavior and implementing the logic in the form of
algorithms resulting in inventions of software, devices, robots, etc
, making human
race smarter

There are many areas which contribute to artiﬁcial intelligence which includes
mathematics (used for developing algorithms), biology, philosophy, psychology,neuroscience (for studying human mind and its behavior), statistics (for handlinghuge data), and last but not the least, computer science (to run the algorithm for
implementing the concepts)
 The basic aim of AI is to provide more transparent,
interpretable, and explainable systems which can help to establish a better-equippedsystem used as an intelligent agent
 The concept of trusting machine as a replica of
human started with the invent of turing test in which the machine is tested irrespective
of the knowledge of examiner upon the instructions given considering it as humanand if it passes the test, the machine is considered as intelligent
 No wonder AI has
affected many aspects of the society and presented a new modern era in this digital
revolution
1 Types of AI (Based on Capabilities)
The various types of artiﬁcial intelligence based on the capabilities can be classiﬁed
as
– Weak or narrow AI
– General AI
– Strong AI
Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 25
W eak or narrow AI : it is a type of AI which can perform a predeﬁned narrow set of
instructions without exhibiting any thinking capability
 It is the most widely used type
of AI in this world
 Some famous examples are Apples’s Siri, Alexa, Alpha Go, IBM’sWatson supercomputer, Sophia (the humanoid) all belong to the weak AI type [ 3]

General AI : it is the type of AI which can perform the tasks like what human can
do
 Till now it is not achieved, there are no such machines which works like humanor can think as perfectly as human, but it may happen in near future

Strong AI : it is the type of AI in which it is expected that the machine will surpass
the capacity of human
 It will perform better than humans, though it is tough, but it
is not impossible
 It may be the situation when it can be said that the machines will
be the master and overtake humans
2 Types of AI (Based on Functionality)
Based on the functionality, artiﬁcial intelligence can be classiﬁed as per the followingtypes:
(i) Reactive machines
(ii) Limited memory
(iii) Theory of mind
(iv) Self-awareness

Reactive machines : these are the machines which works on the data available in the
form of predeﬁned dataset
 IBM’s chess
program which defeated famous champion Garry Kasparov and the deep blue system,
Google’s AlphaGo are some of the examples for reactive machines [ 3]
 An example for limited memory AI isthe self-driving cars (it can store the information like speed, distance, speed limit
required for the navigation of the car)

Theory of mind : these are types of machines, which are expected to understand the
psychological and emotional aspects of human mind and work accordingly
 So far
such machines are a dream but scientists are working to develop such machines in
near future

Self-awareness : these machines belong to a hypothetical concept that will be consid-
ered as super-intelligent machines, which can think, act, and will be self-aware as
they will have consciousness and sentiments like humans
 Research is carried out todevelop such machines and considered as future AI
3 Domains of AI
The major domains of AI (Fig
 1) are neural network, robotics, expert systems, fuzzy
logic systems, natural language processing (NLP)

Neural networks : these can be described as the representation of human neural
system, i
, neurons and dendrites in the form of layers and nodes representing data

It comprises algorithms that understand the relationships between the data while
mimicking the human brain
 These are widely used in AI in the form of machine
learning and deep learning
 Some of the typical examples are pattern recognition offace and image recognition in medical diagnosis

Robotics : it is the domain of AI which is mostly associated with the development of
intelligent machines in the form of robot which obeys human instructions
 The use of
robots or humanoids is a new trend and is being appreciated and adopted worldwide

Robots used in industry, medical surgery, restaurants, etc

Expert system : these are systems which make decisions with the help of data present
in the knowledge base and getting guidance by an expert
 These are basically
computer applications developed to solve complex problems with intelligence and
expertise

Fuzzy logic system : this domain is considered as resembling the human thinking
method and decision-making
 It is quite similar to the way humans decide between 0
and 1, but it also deals with all the possibilities between 0 and 1

Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 27
Natural language processing (NLP) : this domain deals with bridging the gap of
communication between the computer and human languages
 It is basically the inter-
action between computer and human in a smart way

2 Subsets of Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial intelligence has emerged as a boon for the society for the furtherance of
advanced techniques to deal with the real-life problems
 The major two subsets of
AI are Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)
 ML is considered as thesubset of AI and DL is considered as the subset of ML
 The pictorial representation
of the relationship between AI, ML, and DL is shown in Fig
1 Machine Learning
As humans can think, improve by self-improvement cycle, and learn from the past
experiences, AI machines can also learn from the past experiences with the help of
the concept known as Machine Learning (ML)
 The machine learning deals with the
development of algorithms that enables the computer to learn from its data and pastexperiences on their own [ 4]
 In this method, the machine analyzes the available data
set which is also known as training data and with the help of the algorithms predict thepossible output over the given input
 In other words, the relationship between
the data and efﬁciency is that the machine can improve its efﬁciency by gaining
Fig
 2 Relationship between
AI, ML, and DL

 It can learn from the data and improve automatically
 This
is very much helpful for dealing with huge data of complex problems, which are
difﬁcult for humans to deal with and they also consume more time in solving
 In thisprocess of computing the machine receives data as input and provides result using
an appropriate algorithm

Classiﬁcation of Machine Learning
Based on the nature of the learning signal or response that the machine gets; machine
learning can be classiﬁed into following categories:
(i) Supervised learning
(ii) Unsupervised learning
(iii) Reinforcement learning

Supervised learning : according to the literal meaning, this method correlates with
the method of learning of student under the supervision of a teacher
 As a teacher
illustrates the student with many good examples to help in grasping the concept
perfectly, the machine is provided with many labeled data to help in obtaining theperfect output from the given input
 The algorithms under this method are classiﬁed
into two categories, i
, regression and classiﬁcation

Unsupervised learning : in this method the machine has to train itself without any
supervisor, i
, the data provided at the input are not labeled or classiﬁed
 Thealgorithm has to train itself by searching the degree of similarities among the given
data and ﬁgure out the appropriate output for the given problem
 The algorithm helps
to reﬁne the data which can be correlated with the desired output

Reinforcement learning : this method is typically a feedback-based learning method

In this method the machine is given a reward for every right action taken by it and
a penalty for any wrong action, so it is a self-learning method done by analyzing its
past performances
 The objective of the algorithm is to achieve maximum rewardpoints
 Examples for reinforcement learning is a robotic dog learning by its own
mistakes and performances, computer playing video games by their own

The machine learning algorithm is widely being used in multiple ﬁelds such as
medical diagnosis, image processing, web search engines, photo tagging applica-tions, ﬁnance and marketing sector, fraud detection, weather forecasting, and many
more
 The main advantage is the repetitive process and self-learning methods that itapplies to ﬁnd the output

2 Challenges and limitation of ML
The basic challenge and limitation for ML are that it requires huge amount of data

Without quality data, ML algorithm cannot provide accurate results for further anal-ysis
 With wide
range of inputs or datasets, the efﬁciency of the algorithm will be enhanced withappropriate output
 It is similar to that of a new entrant in an organization making
mistakes as junior and eventually improves by self-learning and provides output with
required accuracy and efﬁciency
3 Deep Learning
Deep Learning (DL) is considered as the subdomain of ML and thereby the subset
of AI
 In ML, the system is provided with given input data sets and subjected to
self-learning from the past experiences and give predictions as output
 Deep learningcan be denoted as the next level of machine learning where the system is similar to
human nervous system and mimic the working of the neurons
 In ML the system is
mostly put either in supervised or unsupervised learning method with multilayers ofalgorithms undergoing such learning methods
 As the number of layers increases, it
is called as deep learning or Deep Neural Network (DNN) [ 8]
 The initial layer is
denoted as the input layer, the last layer is called the output layer and the intermediate
layers are termed as the hidden layer, where all the layers are interconnected [ 9]
 The
amount of the depth of the network in terms of layers decides how efﬁcient thealgorithm can do the dense representation of any data (for example, in an image, theedge, boundaries, etc
 It helps in enhanced feature
extraction, pattern recognition of complex dataset and high-level data extraction
 The process of deep learning
begins with the understanding the problem given, identifying the data, selecting theproper algorithm followed by training and testing the model
1 Types of Neural Networks
Basically neural networks can be classiﬁed into two categories, namely,
I
 Shallow neural network (in which there is only one single hidden layer
between the input and output layer) as shown in Fig
 3 Schematic diagram of asimple and bdeep learning neural network
II
 Deep neural network (in which there are multiple hidden layers between the
input and output layer and it is the most widely used network) as shown in
Fig

The deep neural networks are further broadly classiﬁed into three categories:
(a) F eed-forward neural networks : it is the single way data transmission type of
network in which the data moves towards the output layer through the inputlayer

(b) Recurrent neural networks : in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), there is a
recurrent ﬂow of data from the output to the input to generate the memory for

Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 31
the system, learn from the data and produce results
 Some of the major appli-
cations of the RNN are the Chatbots, fraud detection algorithms in monetary
transaction, providing caption for images, and many more [ 11]

(c) Convolutional neural networks : the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
are the most widely used neural networks which have multi-layered neuralnetwork
 The CNN is considered to be the most efﬁcient form of neural networkwhich is basically used for feature extraction of images and pattern recognition
 The CNN network is widely
used method and algorithm in the application of deep learning and is basicallyused for image identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation
 The basic CNN network consists oftwo parts, i
, feature extractor and classiﬁer
 The feature extractor contains the
convolutional and pooling layers whose purpose is to extract the minute features
from the image in terms of pixel data
 The convolutional layer deals with the
feature extraction of the image and preserving the relevant data about the
pixels
 The poolinglayers reduce the dimensionality of an image while retaining the important
information
 As CNN is a multilayer neuron network, the role classiﬁer part
of the network is to classify the information obtained from convolution andpooling layers
 This role is played by the fully connective layer whose motive
is to connect each node of a layer with other nodes

is placed in the input layer is produced in the output layer if passed through a
simple image detection CNN network

The biggest challenge and limitation of DL is to acquire large amount of data and
label it accurately to help the machine while learning the data
 Another challengethat could arise is the degree of interpretability which should be high and accurate

3 Applications of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Modern World
Artiﬁcial intelligence has been evolved as one of the most important technology in
this world, with its impact on almost every ﬁeld of human endeavor
 It was all started
in the year 1950s, after its invention by John McCarthy (the father of AI)
 The 24 ×7 Internet
facility, the invention of cloud technology, the concept of big data, sensors, and other
technological advancements have turned up as a boon for the development of AI

Although AI has not yet replaced humans completely, it has assisted humans to a
great extend in solving and handling the problems which are difﬁcult and risky
 Inthe form of intelligent machines, it has played the role of representative of human
beings
 Today, AI has found wide applications in agriculture, business, education,
entertainment industry, medical, defense, and space technology where it has crucialand admirable effects
 It hasalso many amazing applications of robotics in the form of robots performing surgery
or assisting in diagnosis
 Basically, AI deals with large amount of data to obtain the
required results, and accordingly the algorithms are designed to reduce the chances
of error and provide accurate results
 Following are few of the application areas of AI and
data based on some case studies

The implementation of AI and its technologies has signiﬁcantly played its role in
improving the situation of agriculture industry
Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 33
moving forward in the pest/weed control methods and lastly to the crop harvesting
and supply of produce to the right place and at justiﬁable rate [ 15,16]
 With the
advent of AI, sensor technology and Internet this industry has beneﬁtted to a large
extent
 In soil analysis and monitoring, AI can help us to know about the soil and seed
relationship
 AI-based apps, basically with the help of
sensors, pictures, and infrared rays help to determine the quality and properties of
soil

Moving to the next application is the sowing process enhancement by the use of
AI sowing app
 In another study, the
development of machine learning technology along with integrated computer visionapplications by Blue River Technologies aimed to optimize the herbicide and pest
control

In a different study done on the crop harvesting, it was found that the time taken by
AI-based robots in tomato farms in Japan, is lesser than the time taken by the human
 But unfortunately, till date, AI is unable to stop any fraud cases

However, with the help of AI many fraud detection methods and technologies are now
offered to make the system more robust

In the ﬁnance and banking sector, AI has come up with many technological aids
either in form of apps or methods to prevent from frauds, enhance better customer datastorage/retrieval, and many more
 Similarly, in business sector, AI has helped many IT ﬁrms like Deloitte, IBM,Infosys to bloom in the market as a better technological service provider
 AI has helped the students worldwide to get access to the
huge amount of data in the forms of syllabus, curriculum, textbooks, research articlesand papers, and e-learning to a greater extent [ 17]
, which is an AI research and development
company, smart, and customized educational content can be created and developedwhich help the students to get access of the customized study materials
 It basically
uses the concept of deep learning
 In a hackathon (organized by NITI Ayog), ReadEx
was featured which helped to generate real-time questions using natural languageprocessing and also provided content recommendations and ﬂashcard creation
 In
a recent study, the Andhra Pradesh government (India) was aided by a predictive
analysis done with the assistance of Microsoft using some Azure machine learningprocess to ﬁnd the dropouts of students in an academic institution
 Inanother study, AI has put the fact of how Wikipedia handled the situation of decreased
level of content writers by 40% and the problem of controlling abusive comments
by the users
 It uses AI and associate technology to deal with it and now its AI whowrites for Wikipedia which has really changed the world

4 Entertainment and Gaming
This industry does not need much introduction and effect of AI in this
 The famous Netﬂix uses AI and big data to manage the search
and provides the better content recommendation and many more ways to help users
for better access of data
 Gaming industry also uses AI to improve the quality of thegame and secure the data provided by the users
5 Health Care
Artiﬁcial intelligence has its maximum effect in this sector and has totally trans-
formed the way of treatment and diagnosis
 The goal of having a very effective
healthcare system of a nation can now be achieved in many way by difﬁcult taskaccomplishments with the help of technology and AI
 The three basic steps of treat-
ment which are detection, diagnosis and analysis, and treatment are now improvised
and enhanced with the advent of artiﬁcial intelligence in this sector
 Since the broad discussion has been done later in this chapter here the focus
is on the role of AI in COVID-19 pandemic in India and worldwide

Role of AI in Handling COVID-19 Pandemic
The role of AI in medical ﬁeld is tremendous as the planet witnessed a pandemic
due to Corona outbreak, which has affected the entire human population with huge
number of death cases
 In this scenario, AI has come with its technologies to helpthe people from getting infected with the virus

with help of AI and ML

(iii) Quick diagnosis : it is true that AI alone cannot treat patients but has assisted
a lot for the quick diagnosis in terms of image analysis of the lungs (CT scan)
of suspected and positive cases
6 Smart Cities and Transportation
This is the area in which the application of AI has its speciﬁc and unique role
 Be it smart homes, parks, roboticequipped restaurants, or the home delivery of food, it is all because of AI

Considering smart mobility and transportation, AI has given autonomous vehicles
the power to detect the chances of accidents and protect the person
 So, the Ministry of Railways,
India used AI technology to help in detecting the problems in the track and avoided
many such accidents

7 Space Exploration
In the present scenario it has become almost impossible to imagine the world without
technology and the effects of AI in space exploration
 The world is aware of the spacemission of Chandrayan-2 and the mission to Mars of ISRO which is not possible
without the help of AI and its application
 Be it NASA or ISRO
or any other space organization, no one can deny the use of AI in space exploration
and how it has enhanced the quality of space exploration
 The satellites sending theimages from space are decoded and extraction of useful information from the images
is done with the help of machine and deep learning
 As per a study in 2015, it has been
known that the space mission of SpaceX Falcon 9 was accomplished with the help
of machine learning which helped it for successful landing at the Cape Canaveral
Air Force Station
 Application of deep learning has assured the automatic landing ofmany aircrafts, accurate data collection and transmission without minimum chances
of human error

With the help of AI, NASA and Google discovered two obscure planets in 2017[Kepler-90i and Kepler-90 g]
 From these studies, it can be assumed how strongly
AI and its subset-based technologies have changed the world in the space exploration
and deﬁnitely, many more to come with the strengths of AI technology in creating aworld of intelligent machines

4 Artiﬁcial Intelligence for Advanced Medical Diagnosis
Medical ﬁeld is the area where the AI has put its most important impact which haschanged the way of medical diagnosis
 The role of AI in medical diagnosis is classiﬁed into two types, i
 All this
has been possible due to the introduction of AI, cloud technology (for data storage
and fast retrieval), the concept of big data, and the use of mobile computing in thehealthcare system
 Eventually the combination of AI, Robotics, Internet of Things
(IoT), and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the new era of healthcare solution
system and an important milestone in the process of fourth industrial revolution
 5) depicts the most important use cases of AI and robotics as
a whole in the healthcare system [ 20]

As per the data from a case study a project named as the project DeepDream which
was developed by Google in 2015 helped to create images of given input and also
imagine all possible features that the image should have
 This method includes the
training of the neural network-based software with millions of images as an input andthen asked to produce images from the selected
 5 Use cases of AI for healthcare system

Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 39
mode of treatment required for them based on their symptoms and health conditions

A similar project for fastening the cancer therapy process is the AI developed by NITI
Ayog organization of Indian government which is named as Digital Pathology whichcontained the images of annotated and curated pathology images
 In a case study, it explains how the
nurse robot Molly which helps the physician in organizing the patients’ symptomsand follow up the treatment process
 An app developed by National Institutes of
Health named as AI AiCure to manage the patient’s prescriptions and manage the
health condition of patient

The basic things on which any AI developer put focus are the data generation,
data management, and disease detection and management

There are also many cases where the drug discovery is done with the help of AI,machine learning, and deep learning technologies and help to ﬁnd the best solutionfor a disease
 But there are few challenges that AI must face in the ﬁeld of medicine
and health care such as the data accuracy, security, integrity, and the interpretability
Still, with all these challenges AI has been working with much accuracy in health
care and not only diagnosis or treatment it has gone beyond that and provided with
some advanced level of medical applications which are being discussed later in thischapter
1 Database Management
In healthcare system, the application of AI, ML, DL, cloud computing, and IoMThas created excellent technologies for the development and services to the healthcaresystem
 In such cases, an advanced level of algorithms by AI and ML
are required to handle big data efﬁciently ensuring no loss of security and integrity
of the data
 For instance, the AI and ML approaches have been used to ﬁnd usefulinformation from the “data lakes” which are large data sets of information extracted
from Electronic health records [ 23]
 With proper data management and data analysis, AI helpsto manage the analytics of the huge data and provides better access to patients and
doctors
2 Advanced Medical Devices
In medical and healthcare services, AI and its related technology has spelled its
magic in the development of medical devices used for treatment

In 2016, Medtronic a leading medical device company, in collaboration with IBM
Watson developed the SugarIQ App including the AI technology
Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 41
Fig
3 Drug Design
Artiﬁcial intelligence has already marked its signiﬁcance in drug discovery and nowdrug design is also becoming a chief application of AI in drug development process
 AI has also successfully helped in the drug discovery
method by determining the correct drug molecule and the information about thereaction of proteins in the body before going for design
 For drug design, AI is usedto determine the proper candidate molecules from the reduced graph of the drug

 AI can
also help in differentiating the non-suitable compounds for the drug design which
are not suitable for the patient body
4 Digital Consultation
AI provides digital consultation to the whole world in the form of healthcare chatbots

These are AI-based software solution which provides customized service in form of
messages to the patients or the users without making them realize that they aretalking to any person or any device [ 27]
, Woebot, and others provide a platform for digital consultation to the patients
with the help of AI and related technologies like ML, NLP , and DL
5 Genome Editing
This is totally a different aspect of AI application in which the focus is on thefeatures of genetic composition of a person
 Using the AI and
ML techniques, scientists are now able to know the genomic data using gene editingand sequencing techniques
 Many AI platforms have been developed to enhance the
HTS for a better representation of genome such as DeepV ariant
 Overall, AI has
efﬁciently aided the healthcare system and expected to do more in near future related
to genome editing and more advancements including the genetic screening tools for
the infants
Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 43
5 Conclusion
Artiﬁcial intelligence and its related technology like machine learning, deep learning,
natural language processing has invaded the world undergoing fourth phase of indus-trial revolution in a very strong manner

The use of machine learning in health care has really modiﬁed the scenario in the
healthcare system and still there is more scope for research and development
 Thevarious application of deep learning and machine learning has helped in better disease
detection and diagnosis process
 Furthermore, the use of deep learning in image anal-
ysis and data extraction from medical images has helped in detecting some deadly
diseases
 Artiﬁcial intelligence has also spread its spectrumto advance level of medical application and many more research results are leading
to a new venture of application in health sciences
 The common advantages of AI include reducing the workload of humans and
making it easier for them to get much lesser error-prone results for any given set of
problems
 But considering the assumption of AI creating new employment opportu-nities it also predicts the risk of increase in unemployment
 In conclusion, it can be said that AI is the newway of living with and making it the assistance of human
