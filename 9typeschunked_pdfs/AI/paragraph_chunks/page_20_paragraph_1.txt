CT scans was introduced by the GE health care in collaboration with NVIDIA. It
enhanced the medical imaging process and ensures the capture of minute details of
affected body parts which is not possible to get by physically looking at the scan
data.
The invention of IoT and AI has given many devices in form of various mobile
apps to monitor the body required to maintain good health. Patient monitoring systemis also a device or system for monitoring the patients’ detailed activity and helps tocontrol the deterioration of the body by giving feedback and suggestions. One such
development is IntelliVue Guardian Solution, which was done by Philips Healthcares
which uses the concept of artiﬁcial intelligent and makes appropriate predictions foreffective and early managing of health status of a patient.
4.3 Drug Design
Artiﬁcial intelligence has already marked its signiﬁcance in drug discovery and nowdrug design is also becoming a chief application of AI in drug development process.The basic drug development process includes various steps such as the drug target
identiﬁcation and validation, new drugs design, repurposing of drugs, improvement
in research and development, asserting biomedicine conformation, and ﬁnally theclinical trials on patients [ 25]. AI has also successfully helped in the drug discovery
method by determining the correct drug molecule and the information about thereaction of proteins in the body before going for design. For drug design, AI is usedto determine the proper candidate molecules from the reduced graph of the drug
