Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 43
5 Conclusion
Artiﬁcial intelligence and its related technology like machine learning, deep learning,
natural language processing has invaded the world undergoing fourth phase of indus-trial revolution in a very strong manner. It has put its incredible and efﬁcient impacts
on almost every sector, from agriculture to education and even to the space tech-
nology. It has greatly assisted the healthcare system for making it more efﬁcientin providing the services to the patients and being affordable and feasible for use.
The use of machine learning in health care has really modiﬁed the scenario in the
healthcare system and still there is more scope for research and development. Thevarious application of deep learning and machine learning has helped in better disease
detection and diagnosis process. Furthermore, the use of deep learning in image anal-
ysis and data extraction from medical images has helped in detecting some deadly
diseases. It has also its impact in radiology and the use of robots in medical diagnosis
process has its own signiﬁcance. Artiﬁcial intelligence has also spread its spectrumto advance level of medical application and many more research results are leading
to a new venture of application in health sciences. It has greatly changed the daily
activities by digitalizing the universe and getting beneﬁts from the predictive anal-ysis. The common advantages of AI include reducing the workload of humans and
making it easier for them to get much lesser error-prone results for any given set of
problems. But considering the assumption of AI creating new employment opportu-nities it also predicts the risk of increase in unemployment. Furthermore, the cost of
implementation and the complexity of the used algorithms if can be reduced will be
of much use in health care systems. In conclusion, it can be said that AI is the newway of living with and making it the assistance of human.
