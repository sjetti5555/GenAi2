II. Deep neural network (in which there are multiple hidden layers between the
input and output layer and it is the most widely used network) as shown in
Fig. 3b.
The deep neural networks are further broadly classiﬁed into three categories:
(a) F eed-forward neural networks : it is the single way data transmission type of
network in which the data moves towards the output layer through the inputlayer. It does not contain any recurrent movement of information.
(b) Recurrent neural networks : in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), there is a
recurrent ﬂow of data from the output to the input to generate the memory for
