QARagver2: Intermediate Q&A System with Enhanced Monitoring

Description:
This Python script enhances the Q&A system with the following features:

1. **Enhanced Folder Monitoring:**
   - Processes pre-existing, new, and modified files.
   - Logs all file processing events and errors to a log file (`processing2.log`).

2. **File Hashing:**
   - Detects changes in file content using hashes to avoid redundant processing.

3. **Improved Text Chunking:**
   - Uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with optimized chunk size and overlap.

4. **Question-Answering Agent:**
   - Retrieves relevant chunks from ChromaDB.
   - Generates answers using OpenAI's GPT model.

Why?
- To improve efficiency and robustness by handling all file changes dynamically.
- To introduce logging for better tracking and debugging.

QARagver2: Intermediate Q&A System with Folder Monitoring and Basic QA Features

Description:
This Python script builds a Q&A system with the following features:

1. **Folder Monitoring and Processing:**
   - Monitors a specified folder for pre-existing, new, and modified files.
   - Processes various file types (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
   - Extracts content, chunks text, and stores embeddings in ChromaDB.

2. **Question-Answering Agent:**
   - Retrieves relevant data chunks from ChromaDB.
   - Generates answers using OpenAI's GPT model.

3. **Interactive QA Loop:**
   - Allows users to interact with the system via the command line.
   - Displays answers along with their sources dynamically.

4. **Basic Logging:**
   - Logs file processing events and errors in a log file (`processing2.log`).

Instructions:
- Place the script in a folder and specify the folder to monitor in `folder_to_monitor`.
- Run the script, and interact with the Q&A system via the command line.
