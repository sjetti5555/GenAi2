QARagver3: Basic Q&A System with Contextual Interaction

Description:
This Python script adds contextual interaction and fallback responses to the Q&A system:

1. **Interactive QA Improvements:**
   - Retrieves the top 5 most relevant chunks for answering queries.
   - Provides fallback responses when no relevant data is found.

2. **Session Context Tracking:**
   - Prepares for tracking and handling follow-up questions intelligently.

3. **Enhanced Logging:**
   - Improved details for better tracking of file activities in `processing3.log`.

4. **Question-Answering Agent:**
   - Retrieves data from ChromaDB and generates responses using OpenAI's GPT model.

Why?
- To enhance user experience with clear answers and fallback mechanisms.
- To prepare for advanced features like follow-up questions.

QARagver3: Basic Q&A System with File Monitoring and Processing

Description:
This Python script implements a basic Q&A system with the following features:

1. **File Monitoring and Processing:**
   - Monitors a specified folder for pre-existing, new, and modified files.
   - Processes various file types (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
   - Extracts content, chunks text, and stores embeddings in ChromaDB.

2. **Question-Answering Agent:**
   - Retrieves relevant data chunks from ChromaDB.
   - Generates answers using OpenAI's GPT model.

3. **Interactive QA Loop:**
   - Allows users to interact with the system via the command line.
   - Provides answers based on the processed data.

4. **Robust Logging:**
   - Logs all file processing events and errors in a log file (`processing3.log`).

Instructions:
- Place the script in a folder and specify the folder to monitor in `folder_to_monitor`.
- Run the script, and interact with the Q&A system via the command line.
