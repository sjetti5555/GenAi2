conditions. The medical data and records maintenance, the payment facility, and
many more applications are used in the healthcare system. Since healthcare system
is one of the most important sectors for any nation, it really needs to be improveda lot to facilitate the people and enhance quality treatment in this sector. All this
has been possible due to the introduction of AI, cloud technology (for data storage
and fast retrieval), the concept of big data, and the use of mobile computing in thehealthcare system. Eventually the combination of AI, Robotics, Internet of Things
(IoT), and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the new era of healthcare solution
system and an important milestone in the process of fourth industrial revolution.Following image (Fig. 5) depicts the most important use cases of AI and robotics as
a whole in the healthcare system [ 20].
As per the data from a case study a project named as the project DeepDream which
was developed by Google in 2015 helped to create images of given input and also
imagine all possible features that the image should have. This method includes the
training of the neural network-based software with millions of images as an input andthen asked to produce images from the selected. Based on some case studies on the
combating technologies for the most common deadly disease which is cancer a soft-
ware was introduced by the IBM, namely, Watson for oncology, including both ML
and NLP technologies, in 2016. It helped the patients to get to know about the correct
