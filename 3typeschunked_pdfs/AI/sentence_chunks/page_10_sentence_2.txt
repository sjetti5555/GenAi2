Some of the major appli-
cations of the RNN are the Chatbots, fraud detection algorithms in monetary
transaction, providing caption for images, and many more [ 11].
(c) Convolutional neural networks : the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
are the most widely used neural networks which have multi-layered neuralnetwork.
