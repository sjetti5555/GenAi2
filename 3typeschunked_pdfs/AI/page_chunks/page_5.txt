1.3 Domains of AI
The major domains of AI (Fig. 1) are neural network, robotics, expert systems, fuzzy
logic systems, natural language processing (NLP).
Neural networks : these can be described as the representation of human neural
system, i.e., neurons and dendrites in the form of layers and nodes representing data.
It comprises algorithms that understand the relationships between the data while
mimicking the human brain. These are widely used in AI in the form of machine
learning and deep learning. Some of the typical examples are pattern recognition offace and image recognition in medical diagnosis.
Robotics : it is the domain of AI which is mostly associated with the development of
intelligent machines in the form of robot which obeys human instructions. The use of
robots or humanoids is a new trend and is being appreciated and adopted worldwide.
Robots used in industry, medical surgery, restaurants, etc., are classiﬁed under thiscategory.
Expert system : these are systems which make decisions with the help of data present
in the knowledge base and getting guidance by an expert. These are basically
computer applications developed to solve complex problems with intelligence and
expertise.
Fuzzy logic system : this domain is considered as resembling the human thinking
method and decision-making. It is quite similar to the way humans decide between 0
and 1, but it also deals with all the possibilities between 0 and 1. Examples of fuzzylogic systems used are in consumer electronics, automobiles, comparison of data,
etc.
