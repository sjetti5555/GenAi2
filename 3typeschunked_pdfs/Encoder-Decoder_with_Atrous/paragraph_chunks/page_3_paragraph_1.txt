DeepLabv3+: Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution 3
semantic segmentation, and applying the atrous separable convolution to b oth
the ASPP and decoder modules. Finally, we demonstrate the eﬀectiv eness of the
proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasts and attain the
test set performance of 89.0% and 82.1% without any post-processing, settin g a
new state-of-the-art.
In summary, our contributions are:
–We propose a novel encoder-decoder structure which employs De epLabv3 as
a powerful encoder module and a simple yet eﬀective decoder mo dule.
–In our structure, one can arbitrarily control the resolution of extracte d en-
coder features by atrous convolution to trade-oﬀ precision and runtime ,
which is not possible with existing encoder-decoder models.
–WeadapttheXceptionmodelforthesegmentationtaskandapplydepthwise

in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network.
–Our proposed model attains a new state-of-art performance on PASCAL
VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets. We also provide detailed analysis of
design choices and model variants.

ModelsbasedonFullyConvolutionalNetworks(FCNs)[ 8,11]havedemonstrated
signiﬁcant improvement on several segmentation benchmarks [ 1,2,3,4,5]. There
are several model variants proposed to exploit the contextual informati on for
segmentation [ 12,13,14,15,16,17,32,33], including those that employ multi-scale
inputs (i.e., image pyramid) [ 34,35,36,37,38,39] or those that adopt probabilistic
graphical models (such as DenseCRF [ 40] with eﬃcient inference algorithm [ 41])
[42,43,44,37,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,39]. In this work, we mainly discuss about the
models that use spatial pyramid pooling and encoder-decoder struc ture.
Spatial pyramid pooling: Models,suchasPSPNet[ 24]orDeepLab[ 39,23],
perform spatial pyramid pooling [ 18,19] at several grid scales (including image-
level pooling [ 52]) or apply several parallel atrous convolution with diﬀerent
rates (called Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling, or ASPP). These models h ave
shown promising results on several segmentation benchmarks by expl oiting the
multi-scale information.
Encoder-decoder: The encoder-decoder networks have been successfully
appliedtomanycomputervisiontasks,includinghumanposeestimati on[53],ob-
jectdetection[ 54,55,56],andsemanticsegmentation[ 11,57,21,22,58,59,60,61,62,63,64].
Typically, the encoder-decoder networks contain (1) an encoder mo dule that
gradually reduces the feature maps and captures higher semantic inform ation,
and (2) a decoder module that gradually recovers the spatial information . Build-
ing on top of this idea, we propose to use DeepLabv3 [ 23] as the encoder module
and add a simple yet eﬀective decoder module to obtain sharper segme ntations.
