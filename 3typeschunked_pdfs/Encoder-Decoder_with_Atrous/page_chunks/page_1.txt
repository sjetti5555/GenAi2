Abstract. Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure
are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The
former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual informa tion by
probing the incoming features with ﬁlters or pooling operations a t mul-
tiple rates and multiple eﬀective ﬁelds-of-view, while the la tter networks

information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages fro m
both methods. Speciﬁcally, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, e xtends
DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet eﬀective decoder module to reﬁ ne the
segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We fu rther ex-
plore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable con volution
to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, res ulting

1 Introduction
Semanticsegmentationwiththegoaltoassignsemanticlabelstoeverypi xelinan
image [1,2,3,4,5] is one of the fundamental topics in computer vision. Deep con-
volutional neural networks [ 6,7,8,9,10] based on the Fully Convolutional Neural
Network [ 8,11] show striking improvement over systems relying on hand-craft ed
features [ 12,13,14,15,16,17] on benchmark tasks. In this work, we consider two
types of neural networks that use spatial pyramid pooling module [ 18,19,20] or
encoder-decoder structure [ 21,22] for semantic segmentation, where the former
one captures rich contextual information by pooling features at diﬀere nt resolu-
tion while the latter one is able to obtain sharp object boundaries.
In order to capture the contextual information at multiple scales, Dee pLabv3
[23] applies several parallel atrous convolution with diﬀerent rates (call ed Atrous
