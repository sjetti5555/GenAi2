We apply another 1 Ã—1 convolution on the
low-level features to reduce the number of channels, since the c orresponding low-
level features usually contain a large number of channels ( e.g., 256 or 512) which
may outweigh the importance of the rich encoder features (only 256 chann els in
our model) and make the training harder.
