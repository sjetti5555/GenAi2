Sep Conv 2048, 3x3Exit  flow
Fig.4.We modify the Xception as follows: (1) more layers (same as MSRA’s modiﬁca-
tion except the changes in Entry ﬂow), (2) all the max pooling o perations are replaced
by depthwise separable convolutions with striding, and (3) ex tra batch normalization
and ReLU are added after each 3 ×3 depthwise convolution, similar to MobileNet.
