In this work, we consider two
types of neural networks that use spatial pyramid pooling module [ 18,19,20] or
encoder-decoder structure [ 21,22] for semantic segmentation, where the former
one captures rich contextual information by pooling features at diï¬€ere nt resolu-
tion while the latter one is able to obtain sharp object boundaries.
