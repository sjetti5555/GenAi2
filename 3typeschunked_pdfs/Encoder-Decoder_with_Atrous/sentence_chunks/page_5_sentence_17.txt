For the task of semantic segmentation, one can adopt
output stride = 16 (or 8) for denser feature extraction by removing the striding
in the last one (or two) block(s) and applying the atrous convolution corre spond-
ingly (e.g., we apply rate= 2 and rate= 4 to the last two blocks respectively
foroutput stride = 8).
