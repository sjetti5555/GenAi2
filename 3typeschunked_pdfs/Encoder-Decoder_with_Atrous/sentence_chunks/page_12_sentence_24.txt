4.5 Experimental Results on Cityscapes
In this section, we experiment DeepLabv3+ on the Cityscapes dataset [ 3], a
large-scale dataset containing high quality pixel-level annotations of 5000 i mages
(2975, 500, and 1525 for the training, validation, and test sets respectively) and
about 20000 coarsely annotated images.
