3.1 Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Convolution
Atrous convolution: Atrous convolution, a powerful tool that allows us to ex-
plicitly control the resolution of features computed by deep convolut ional neural
networks and adjust ﬁlter’s ﬁeld-of-view in order to capture multi -scale informa-
tion, generalizes standard convolution operation.
